# Users API

This API was built using a great python framework: `Flask`, together with a `PostgreSQL` database.

The API main sections are `Models/`, `Controllers/` and `Repositories/`

## This API was built with
- Python 3.11 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3116/)

# Steps to configure enviroment

## Clone the repository with this command:
	git clone https://github.com/sousam02/users_API.git

## Creating virtual enviroment
After you clone, go to users_API folder with command line and set the virtual enviroment to avoid dependencies conflicts

    python -m venv .venv
    
## Activating virtual enviroment 
	(WINDOWS) .venv\Scripts\activate
	(LINUX) source .venv/bin/activate

## Installing dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configuring Docker and PostgreSQL

## Download docker
- https://docs.docker.com/compose/

## Download Postgres Image
After the Docker download, you are able to use docker commands. For the api, we need to download the PostgreSQL image. Go to command prompt and execute:

    docker pull postgres

## Create a new container

    docker run --name pg -e POSTGRES_USER=root -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=root -p 5432:5432 -d postgres

## Activating container

    docker start pg

## Connect to bash

    docker exec -it pg bash

## Connect to PostgreSQL
- After you connected to bash, you will see something like this:
- `root@8b288ff4a8e8:/#`
- Now you need to connect to PostgreSQL, execute this command:

		psql -U root
- You will see this:
- `root=#`

## Create `registrations` database and UUID extension
Now you can execute SQL queries to PostgreSQL, you will create the database that API will use.

    CREATE  DATABASE  registrations;


## Connect to the new database

    \c registrations

## Create table `users`
We will use UUID, so we need to use the extension that implements it, and then create users table. Paste this code on command prompt:

    CREATE EXTENSION IF  NOT  EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

    CREATE  TABLE  users (
    	id UUID NOT NULL  UNIQUE  DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    	name  VARCHAR  NOT NULL,
    	cpf VARCHAR  NOT NULL,
    	age VARCHAR  NOT NULL
    );

## Now you are able to consume the API
- Navigate to users_API folder and execute `flask run`

# Code structure
## The project is separated in 3 main folders
- `controllers/` is the folder that is responsible for the API business rules. For example, verify if a CPF already exists when trying to create a new user, or verify if all required fields are set.
- `models/` is the folder where is stored the classes that represent the API entities and logic. In our case we have Users and Database models.
- `repositories/` is the folder responsible to interact with the database, if we need to change the database, the business rules will be protected of these changes.
- `app.py` is in the root of project, and contains the API endpoints to users (Create, Read, Update, Delete and Get user by id)
